Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis
Introduction

The retail sector generates massive amounts of transactional data, and analyzing it helps businesses improve profitability and optimize inventory. This project focuses on identifying profit-draining categories, seasonal product behavior, and strategies to optimize inventory turnover using data-driven insights.

Abstract

The goal of this project was to analyze retail data to uncover insights about sales, profits, inventory movement, and seasonal demand patterns. SQL was used for querying and cleaning data, Python (Pandas, Seaborn) for statistical analysis and correlation studies, and Tableau for building an interactive dashboard. The analysis revealed slow-moving categories, seasonal high-demand items, and profitability patterns across regions and product types, helping in strategic decision-making.

Tools & Technologies Used

SQL – Data cleaning, profit margin calculations, and aggregations

Python (Pandas, Seaborn) – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), correlation analysis

Tableau – Interactive dashboard with filters for region, product type, and season

Steps Involved in Building the Project

Data Import & Cleaning:

Loaded retail dataset into SQL

Handled missing and null values

Removed duplicates for consistency

Data Analysis (SQL & Python):

Calculated sales and profit margins by category and sub-category

Identified underperforming and profit-draining product lines

Ran correlation analysis between inventory days and profitability

Visualization (Tableau):

Built interactive dashboards with filters for product category, region, and season

Highlighted seasonal trends and demand fluctuations

Provided insights into slow-moving and overstocked items

Insights & Recommendations:

Certain product categories had consistently low margins and required strategic re-pricing or discontinuation

Seasonal spikes (festive periods) showed opportunities for targeted marketing and stock management

Overstocked items highlighted the need for better demand forecasting

Conclusion

This project demonstrated how retail businesses can use data analytics to optimize profitability, reduce inventory costs, and improve decision-making. The combination of SQL, Python, and Tableau provided actionable insights into sales trends, profit patterns, and inventory turnover. The approach can be scaled to larger datasets and applied in real-world retail operations.
